# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project.

## Bugs

Please report them by creating an issue in current GitHub project:

https://github.com/dev-experience/generator-xapi-roomkit-macro-debugging/issues

## Testing

Please make necessary tests if you update the code.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/dev-experience/generator-xapi-roomkit-macro-debugging/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.

Thanks,
Vlad DX
